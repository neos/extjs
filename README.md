This package contains ExtJS for use in Flow packages.

It is a slightly trimmed version of ExtJS (missing source, build, examples, documentation) with JavaScript,
images, CSS and Flash moved to distinct folders. In addition it contains the ux files found in the examples
folder of the ExtJS distribution. Using Ext Direct is supported by an Ext Direct request handler and a
viewhelper to build a provider configuration from controller actions.

_It is largely unmaintained by now._
